## Agenda

### Prior session (@indexzero)

- SPDX field in NFT metadata is obvious.
- How would we advocate for adoption of an incremental standard such as this?

### Open Discussion

- @chrisabrams no "media" property. Opensea abuses "image"
- @chrisabrams "media" should be accessible
- @alexvotofuture multiple 3D objects
- @alexvotofuture what about mutability?
  - @indexzero
    https://ceramic.network/
    https://www.geoweb.network/
  - @indexzero examples:
    - Physical redemptions
    - Pack opened or closed
  - @jchris does every chain want to be able to index this?
    - Yes, IPLD & IPNS based names
    - No, use oracles off chain   
- @rickmanelius what about linked references? 
- @jchris for complex data objects, should we be descriptive or prescriptive?
  - Names are pointers to cids which have web-based content structures ("index.html")
- @indexzero multi-chain NFT swaps https://blog.0x.org/introducing-multi-chain-nft-swaps/
  - How does this affect indexing? e.g. find all NFTs for "string query"
- @luax.eth ENS other NFT with the following format. eip155:1/{TOKEN_TYPE(erc721|erc1155):{TOKEN_ADDRESS}/{TOKEN_ID}
- @danforbes appreciate well designed standards, how do we set and evaluate goals for what we want them to accomplish?
  - @indexzero "pogholla" mint "pogs as NFTs" with contracts in Solidity (EVM Compatible), Rust (Solana), Cairo (Starkware)
  - @indexzero what if "properties" was {singular|plural} of all top-level names from schema.org
- @rickmanelius Goals and inventory of NFT classes
  - CAD, Identity, JPEG, Game Item, Universal (SPDX) etc.
  
### Next Meeting

- March 2nd, 2022 (recurring on first Wednesday)
